                <p4>Background:</p4>
                <p3>
                    Before the COVID pandemic, I had a minor interest in personal investing, buying shares 
                    of some companies that I read positive analyst reports for and sitting on them. As I went on with life, 
                    my interest in the financial markets started growing. The articles I would sporadically read in my 
                    Google Feed started shifting from science to finance until I found myself going down the rabbit hole of
                    financial markets. The Japanese yen crisis in 2024 was my first big introduction to the world of finance
                    and economics and since then, my interest has only grown. I started actively investing sometime around May 2025 
                    and realized that keeping track of my portfolio was incredibly time-consuming. I had other things to do so 
                    I thought of a solution. That solution is this project.
                </p3>
                <p4>Summary:</p4>
                <p3>
                    I developed a Python script that would track selected stock prices in real time and depending on the 
                    price change, send a notification to users detailing which stock moved how much. I also added functionalities 
                    to notify the user of the latest news related to the stocks and upcoming earnings calls on the market opening bell. 
                    This project is made with free-to-use APIs from trustworthy financial information providers.

                <p3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used WebSockets to track real-time stock prices persistently</li>
                        <li>Used third party APIs to collect stock news and earnings schedules and send notifications to users</li>
                        <li>Hosted the script on PythonAnywhere to automatically execute every day on market open</li>
                    </ul>
