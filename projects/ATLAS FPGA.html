                <p4>Summary:</p4>
                <p3>This project was a capstone project undertaken in the 4th year of my Engineering Physics degree. The project was sponsored by TRIUMF, 
                    Canada's national particle accelerator center, in collaboration with CERN, the world's leading patricle physics research organization. 
                    For this project, I and 3 other team members conducted research and development on the deployment of neural networks (NNs) on FPGAs for use 
                    on CERN's ATLAS particle detector triggering system. Traditionally, NNs are built using Python and are trained and run using GPUs. The challenge 
                    of our project lies in attempting to convert the NN into an FPGA-compatible language, known as an HDL, like VHDL of Verilog and optimizing its 
                    performance when it runs on the FPGA unit. HDLs are low-level languages and while possible, it would be highly inefficient to convert the Python NN code 
                    to equivalent HDL code by hand. So to solve this problem, we explored the conversion of Python NN model implementations to a C/C++ implementation 
                    and consequently, the use of Vitis HLS software which converts C/C++ into an HDL that can run on our FPGA unit. You can find our final project report below.
