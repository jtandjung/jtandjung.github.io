        <p>Closed Loop Motor Speed Controller</p>
        <p4>Summary:</p4>
        <br>
        <p3>This was the final project of a project/lab course meant to teach students about electronics design through hands-on circuit construction 
            and data acquisition and analysis using the Digilent AD2 (a USB oscilloscope, logic analyzer, and multi-function instrument). This project was centered around building and understanding an optomechanical circuit 
            that can actively control the speed of a servomotor. The project consisted of breadboarding the circuit and investigating the behavior and purpose of 
            each major subcircuit. As part of the final grade, a wire pull test is conducted where the instructor moves a random wire on the breadboard and the student must 
            identify which wire was changed and correct the circuit. Below is the final report I generated for this project.</p3>
        <br>
        <p4>Results:</p4>
        <p3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learned fundamental electronics design through breadboarding and analysis of various circuits</li>
                <li>Learned to troubleshoot circuits using data acquisition tools such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, waveform generators, etc.</li>
                <li>Successfully passed wire pull test, troubleshooting and fixing the circuit in less than 2 minutes</li>
            </ul>
        </p3>
