        <p>Intelligent Self-Driving Car</p>
        <br>
        <p3>This project was for a third year Engineering Physics course focused on AI/ML techniques. The project is 
            completed in Linux and centers around developing a program for a self-driving car that can read characters 
            and letters off signs in a simulated ROS environment. While the main focus of this course was the project itself, 
            students also learn about various AI/ML topics such as SIFT, the math behind backpropagation, reinforcement learning, and more. 
            You can see a video (coming soon) of my program in action below as well as a report detailing the program's development process.

        <p4>
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully created an AI agent capable of reading letters and numbers with over 99.9% accuracy</li>
                <li>Learned how to use ROS and Linux</li>
                <li>Achieved proficiency in Python</li>
            </ul>
