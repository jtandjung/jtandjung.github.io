                <p4>Every summer, the UBC campus is much quieter than usual. Most students spend their time in the rare Vancouver sunshine, maybe taking a light course or two to get a small headstart on the next academic year. 
                    For the newest cohort of Engineering Physics students though, their first summer in the program is known affectionately as Robot Summer, an experience completely different from a regular UBC summer.
                    The highlight of Robot Summer is the 6 weeks students spend building an autonomous tape-following robot from scratch. Each year, the robots also have to be designed to do different things according to a 
                    changing theme and in my year, the theme was "Mario Kart". It's pretty much what you think it is: two robots on a track, racing each other while avoiding bombs, taking shortcuts, and collecting coins. Robot Summer 
                    was an incredible experience and you can see what my team and I built below.</p4>
